I would likely spend more freely on experiences that bring joy and fulfillment rather than accumulating material possessions or focusing on long-term investments. For example, I might travel to places I’ve always wanted to see, attend events or concerts, or spend quality time with family and friends, even if these activities are expensive. I would still budget carefully to ensure I could maximize meaningful experiences, but I would likely stop saving for retirement or long term goals , since they would no longer be relevant. Some of my spending might also go toward  gifts or acts of kindness for loved ones, creating lasting memories or supporting causes I care about. Essentially, the priority would shift from financial security to making the most of the limited time left and enriching the lives of myself and those around me.
","If I only had six months left, I would dramatically shift my time toward the people and experiences that matter most. I’d spend far less time on anything routine, stressful, or obligatory, and far more time being present with loved ones. I would prioritize meaningful conversations, traveling to places that have personal significance, reconnecting with old friends, and doing activities that bring joy—like being in nature, sharing meals, and creating memories that feel warm and lasting. I would also make time for reflection, gratitude, and tying up emotional loose ends so nothing important is left unsaid.","On my last day, I’d want the day to feel peaceful, intentional, and full of connection. I imagine waking up early to watch the sunrise, ideally somewhere beautiful maybe by the ocean or in a quiet place surrounded by nature. I’d spend the day with the people I love most, sharing stories, laughing, and expressing everything I appreciate about them. I’d enjoy my favorite foods, listen to music that means something to me, and make sure everyone knows how much they’ve shaped my life. As the day winds down, I’d want to watch the sunset with someone close, feeling calm, loved, and grateful, ending the day in a setting that feels warm, gentle, and full of meaning.","Deepen Relationships
